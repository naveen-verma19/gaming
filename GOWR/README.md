**How to use my Save files** 
- Delete all your save files after taking a backup
- Copy all my save files into C:/Users/username/Saved Games/God of War RagnarÃ¶k/1455301964
- I am using Realm shift build. The save files are mostly at Sindri's House where you can upgrade and equip your armor and weapons (All armor/enchantments/weapons are available and can be fully upgraded to Level 10) before you start
